# Favorite Riders: MotoGP

Building...also learning...

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## What's the aim of this project?

I am a huge fan of MotoGP and I wanted to build an app to help keep track of my favorite riders throughout the MotoGP season. This is also a learning project for building a full-stack CRUD app. Feature set will likely start with social login via NextAuth, basic follow/unfollow and fetching rider info. I will be adding the ability to scrape or pull data sources as I go along, likely starting with Twitter.
